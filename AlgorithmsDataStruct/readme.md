The artifact I selected is a course catalog application originally developed in C++ for CS300: Data Structures and Algorithms in April 2024. It reads a course list from a CSV file and allows users to display all courses and search for specific courses. The program uses a binary search tree to manage course data efficiently, supporting quick searches and maintaining ordered traversals.
