The artifact selected for enhancement is an advising program developed for CS300: Data Structures and Algorithms, completed in April 2024. The program imports a course list from a CSV file and allows users to either display all courses in order or search for a specific course. To manage the data efficiently, I implemented a binary search tree (BST), which supports quick searches and ordered traversals. The data set provided resulted in a balanced tree, ensuring smooth performance throughout program execution.
