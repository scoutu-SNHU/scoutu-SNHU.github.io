The artifact I selected is the Animal Shelter Dashboard application originally developed in Python using Dash for CS-340: Client/Server Development in March 2025. The dashboard was designed to connect to a MongoDB database and visualize adoption data through an interactive map, filters, and charts. For this enhancement, I refactored the database layer to integrate Firebase as the backend, replacing local MongoDB access with a secure, cloud-based authentication and data storage solution.
